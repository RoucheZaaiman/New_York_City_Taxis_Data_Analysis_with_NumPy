# New_York_Taxis_Data_Analysis_with_NumPy
In these project based exercises selected fundamental to intermediate Numpy operations are applied to do calculations.  The New York City Taxis dataframe is converted into an array to perform more Mathematical-like operations on the data.  

Fundamental Numpy operations and calculations used in these project based exercises are as follows:  
•	Selecting and slicing rows and columns, 
•	Using the coefficient of variation to determining the disparity of the data
•	Changing an image to a NumPy ndarray
•	Vector Maths e.g. determining the miles/hour for each trip using vectors (columns) and determining the total amount paid by a client. 

Intermediate operations and calculations in this notebook are as follows:  
•	Creating Boolean arrays to aid various calculations e.g. calculating how many trips were made to or from a specific airport, finding the most popular airport and cleaning the array from outliers.
•	Assigning specific values for sliced rows and columns (e.g. changing the format of the year column from 2016 to 16 and correcting wrong values in the array). 

The Numpy exercises was done through DataQuest and they also provided the dataset nyc_taxis.csv.  Originally these exercises was done using pure Python, but I converted the code to run in this Jupyter Notebook.  The original Python code will also be made available in this notebook in the near future.
